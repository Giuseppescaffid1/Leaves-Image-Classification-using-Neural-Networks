# Leaves-Image-Classification-using-Neural-Networks

This Project aims to compare two versions of the same algorithm, Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN), that were built,trained and tuned in different ways. The first model
was developed as a binary classifier, assigning either labels 0 if the leaf is healthy or 1 if
the leaf is unhealthy.
The comparison between the two models will be based specifically on evaluation me-
trics, with particular focus on the F1 (the harmonic mean of the precision and recall)
macro-average score as this better accounts for imbalanced datasets by weighting classes
equally. The results of this study will provide insight into the effectiveness of different
training and hyperparameter tuning techniques as methods to improving the performan-
ce of CNN models for image classification tasks

The model implemented in this repositorie concerns Binary Classification model using CNN while the next model will be implemente in antoher github repo.
